## Note

Note: For Windows users, if you're installing this game, you need to run the following command on PowerShell with admin
privileges:

```shell
CheckNetIsolation.exe LoopbackExempt -a -n="Microsoft.Win32WebViewHost_cw5n1h2txyewy"
```

This command allows Edge to read files on the local host (This app uses Edge as the backend on Windows).

_Or just use the web version to avoid headache._
